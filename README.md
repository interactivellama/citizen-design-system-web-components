## About

This repository explores the possibility of implementing web components for the Citizen Design System by MuleSoft on top of [Elix](https://component.kitchen/elix) components.

## Quick Start

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Dependencies

This project requires little to no dependencies. The primitive layers requires Elix, which serves the customizable web components to build our interfaces for our Design System and its Sub Systems.

- `Node ^8.x` for a static web server to load ES modules.
- `Elix` for customizable authored web components.
